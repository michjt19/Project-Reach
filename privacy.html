      <h3>1. Your Privacy Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Reach Collective is committed to protecting your privacy. We offer anonymous,
        peer-based support—without requiring personal information or account creation.
      </p>

      <h3>2. What We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        We collect as little as possible. No personal identifying information is required to use our site or chat.
        However, to operate the service, we may capture:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chat conversations</strong> (via Tawk.to or SMS), stored temporarily for safety and training</li>
        <li><strong>Basic technical info</strong> (e.g., browser type or screen size) to improve usability</li>
        <li><strong>Phone number</strong> (for SMS users only)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. How We Use This Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To ensure safety and quality of support interactions</li>
        <li>To train volunteer listeners and improve service delivery</li>
        <li>To detect patterns of misuse or crisis escalation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for advertising or marketing.</p>

      <h3>4. Anonymity and Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        You are responsible for what you choose to share. We encourage using a nickname and avoiding sensitive details.
        If you provide identifiable information during a high-risk situation, we may escalate appropriately.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Storage and Retention</h3>
      <p>
        Conversations may be retained securely for up to 12 months for audit and training. You can request deletion by emailing us at

      </p>

      <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://www.tawk.to/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tawk.to</a> to power our live chat.
        Your use of the chat widget is also subject to their privacy terms.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
